# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

# RUN THE .JSON FILE BEFORE RUNNING THE APP. 
this is because we are using port 3000 for the axios api call and the application
can just run on port http://localhost:3001

### `To run the members data file`
cd into frontend and type "json-server --watch src/members.json" in the terminal

### `To run the drugs data file`
cd into frontend and type "json-server --watch src/drugs.json" in the terminal
